# What's NASA Cooking
> v. 1.1

### My first full-stack application that I am proud to share with the world! 

Description: It fetches the requests from NASA's API and shows a new image to registered users.

Link: [WNC-Vercel.app](https://whats-nasa-cooking.vercel.app/)

I'm using *Vercel* as the host for my front-end, *MongoDB Atlas* for the DB and *Heroku* as a server for my backend.

To install the app, use `npm install`.
